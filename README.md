# Sorabji

This is an early-stage DSL for accepting user input in a Rails app. Goals are to provide a simple syntax for non-developer users to transform hashes or hash-like entities (like Mongoid documents), and sandboxing user scripts to protect the app and server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sorabji'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sorabji
